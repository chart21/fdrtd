# description

**fdrtd** is a free and open source implementation of **federated secure computing**,
a modern microservice architecture for privacy-preserving computation:

- [x] multi-protocol technology platform (e.g. secure multipary computation)
- [x] cryptography is offloaded to the server/cloud (separation of concerns)
- [x] client-side business logic is easy to implement (no barriers to entry)
- [x] toolbox of specific microservices (no complex monolithic universality)
- [x] runs in virtually any environment (compatibility and interoperability)
- [x] OpenAPI 3.0 standard for 3rd party developers (plug & play extensions)
